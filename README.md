# CSS Battle

On this site I will share my solutions for challenges from [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev). 

On CSS Battle, you can find a new target every day for you to unwind. You will see a finished design that you can try to reproduce down to the pixel. They have a built in IDE, and a preview display with a slider so you can see how close you are to matching the design. It is a lot of fun!

For the month of September, I am committing to 30 days of CSS Battle! I will be sharing on [Twitter](https://x.com/NotMichaella) and [GitHub](https://github.com/michaella23), and may even do some live coding on [Twitch](https://twitch.com/NotMichaella).
