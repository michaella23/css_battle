# CSS Battle

With [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev), you can find a new target every day for you to unwind. You will see a finished design that you can try to reproduce down to the pixel. They have a built in IDE, and a preview display with a slider so you can see how close you are to matching the design. It is a lot of fun!

I am committing to 30 days of CSS Battle! I will be sharing on [Twitter](https://x.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com), and may even do some live coding on [Twitch](https://twitch.com). And each day I will add my solutions for challenges from [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev) in this repository.

## Use this template!

If you would like to share your own solutions on GitHub, feel free to use this template I have created. 

1. First, click on **Use this template** and select *Create a new repository*.

You will be able choose a name for your repo, add a description, and choose to make it public or keep it private.  Once you have navigated to your own repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the terminal or your preferred GUI.

3. The template has 2 directories to start with. The files in the `day1` directory are basically ready to go. You can look at the comments to see where to make a few changes and add your code from CSS Battle. The template is structured to link to an external stylesheet, instead of having all the HTML and CSS in the same file.

4. When you have completed the daily challenge, take a screenshot of your solution. Drag and drop that file from Finder/File Manager into the corresponding 'day' directory. **Rename it as `solution.png`.** Now your solution will display in the grid on the home page!

5. You can take a screenshot of some of your code, drag and drop the file into the corresponding 'day' and **rename it as `code.png`**. The styling for this matches that of `solution.png`.

6. In the "text" section, you can describe your general impression of the challenge and how you approached it, things you learned, how well you scored, etc.

7. Currently the anchor tags on the home page link to the `index.html` file for each day. When you click on the link, you'll be directed to that page and either see a larger version of your solution or a blank page with an error (if you haven't yet inserted HTML).

8. Use the comments in each `style.css` file to see where to paste and format your code.

9. Alter any of these files to suit your preference. For subsequent days, you can right-click on one of the `day*` directories, choose the "Copy" option, paste it in the `src` folder, and rename it accordingly. 

10. You may wish to edit this README file to suit your own purposes.

11. Deploy your site, and share with your network! This is a fun way to #BuildInPublic and sharpen your CSS skills!
